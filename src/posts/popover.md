## A Basic Popover

Here is a basic popover. You can use these anytime you need something that overlays. Think a three dot menu, a login / user menu or settings of any kind.

<Menu />

## Popover Actions

## Menu w/ Compatible Anchor

## Menu w/ Anchor Positioning

### Side note - Anchor Positioning

Anchor positioning is a fix for elements placed in the top-layer where relative context doesn't exist. This is how you pin a menu to a location. It's great, but support sucks right now.

But wait?! Is there a Polyfill? 

There is, [Anchor Polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/css-anchor-positioning) but, it's not currently current to the spec, so probably best to use the above listed compatible anchor strategy.
